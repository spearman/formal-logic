Computability Theory (Part \ref{part:recursion_theory}: Recursion Theory)

two Undecidable questions about Iterated Function Systems:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item test if the Attractor of a given IFS \emph{Intersects}
    (\S\ref{sec:intersection}) a given Line Segment
  \item test if a given IFS is \emph{Totally Disconnected}
    (\S\ref{sec:disconnected_space})
\end{enumerate}

Proof by Reducing the Post Correspondence Problem
(\S\ref{sec:post_correspondence}) and Interpreting Strings as Numbers and
Concatenation as Compositions of Affine Transformations
(\S\ref{sec:affine_transformation})

IFS: a collection of $N$ Contractive Affine Transformations with Rational
Coefficients defines a unique Fractal Set which is the Fixed Point
(\emph{Attractor} \S\ref{sec:attractor_repeller}) of a mapping applying the $N$
Affine Transformations and then taking the Union; Approximation (Fixed-point
Iteration ???)

note: allowing for Transformations other than Affine Transformations allows IFSs
to generate Julia Sets (\S\ref{sec:julia_set})

constructing an $\omega$-language (\S\ref{sec:omega_language}) from the Set of
Contractive Affine Transformations $\Sigma$ of an IFS on a Metric Space $(X, d)$
yields a Surjective mapping $\phi : \Sigma^\omega \rightarrow X$, assigning an
``\emph{Address}'' $\sigma \in \Sigma^\omega$ to each Point in the Attractor,
$A \subseteq X$, of the IFS, $\forall x \in X$:
\[
  \phi(\sigma) =
    \lim_{i \rightarrow \infty} \sigma_1(\sigma_2(\ldots(\sigma_i(x))\ldots)) =
    a \in A
\]
that is, from the \emph{Contractivity} of the $\sigma_i$ Transformations, the
Limit $a$ is \emph{independent} of $x$

Determinstic Iterative Algorithm for describing $A$:

initialize a Set $S_1 = \{ B \}$ of Subsets of $X$ with $B \subseteq X$ and
Iteratively apply all $N$ Transformations to each Subset in $S_n$, taking the
Union of the results to be $S_{n+1}$

cf. Fixed-point Iteration \S\ref{sec:fixedpoint_iteration}; in this case the
output of each iteration is $N$ Subsets instead of a single Value

equivalently:
\[
  A = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} S_n
\]

at the $n$-th step, $S_n$ will contain the result of all possible Sequences of
Transformations of length $n$ on the starting Set $B$, i.e.:
\[
  w_{i_1}(w_{i_2}(\ldots(w_{i_n}(B))\ldots))
\]
for all Sequencces $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n$

\emph{Geometric Model of Computation}

\textbf{Lemma 1} \emph{
 For an IFS $\{\reals^2; w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_N\}$ consisting of Affine
 Transformations with Rational Coefficients, and $L$ a Line Segment with
 Rational Endpoints, there is a (Semi)-procedure that Terminates if and only if
 the Attractor $A$ of the IFS does not Intersect $L$.
}

\textbf{Proof} Due to the Contractivity of the Transformations, if at any step
$n$, $L$ does not Intersect, then $L$ will not Intersect on step $n+1$, and so
the Attractor does not Intersect $L$. Conversely, if the Attractor does not
Intersect $L$, then at some step $n$ the intermediate Subsets do not Intersect.
If at any step of running the Deterministic Algorithm on the IFS, none of the
Subsets Intersect $L$, then the Semi-procedure Terminates.

since the Procedure Halts (Accepts) when an Input does not Intersect, the
Attractor represents a graphical ``encoding'' of the Strings \emph{not} in the
Language

cf. other graphical Models of Computation: any Turing Machine can be represented
as a Set of Wang Dominoes that Tile the Plane if and only if the Turing Machine
does not Halt, however in this case the Tiles are more like ``Symbols'' and does
not define in the limiting case a unqiue pattern encoding information about the
behavior of the Machine on all Inputs

one-to-one correspondence between Concatenation of Strings and application of
corresponding Affine Transformations (TODO)

\textbf{Thm. 3, Thm. 4} -- Implies it is Undecidable to test if the Intersection
of the Attractors of two IFSs is empty

an IFS is called \emph{Totally Disconnected} if and only if every Point in $A$
has a \emph{unique} Address, i.e.
$\forall i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}, i \neq j, w_i(A) \cap w_j(A) = \varnothing$

note that being Totally Disconnected is a Property of the IFS, \emph{not} the
Attractor

if an IFS with two Affine Transformations is Totally Disconnected, then its
Attractor is also Totally Disconnected and is therefore a Cantor Set, and if the
IFS is \emph{not} Totally Disconnected, then its Attractor is a Connected Set

a Julie Aset is defined by an IFS with two Transformations that are not Affine
and is therefore either a Conator Set or Connected

an IFS with more than two Transformations might have an Attractor that is
neither a Cantor Set nor Connected

\textbf{Lemma 4} \emph{There exists a Semi-procedure that will Terminate if and
  only if a given IFS is Totally Disconnected}

\textbf{Proof} An IFS is Totally Disconnected if and only if during the
Deterministic Algorithm there is an $i$ such that all the Subsets obtained by
applying all possible Sequences of Transformations of length $i$ are mutually
Disjoint

\textbf{Thm. 5} \emph{It is Undecidable to test if a given IFS is Totally
  Disconnected}
-- i.e. there does not exist a Semi-procedure which Terminates if a given IFS is
\emph{not} Totally Disconnected
