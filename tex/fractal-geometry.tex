two Undecidable questions about Iterated Function Systems:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item test if the Attractor of a given IFS \emph{Intersects}
    (\S\ref{sec:intersection}) a given Line Segment
  \item test if a given IFS is \emph{Totally Disconnected}
    (\S\ref{sec:totally_disconnected})
\end{enumerate}

Proof by Reducing the Post Correspondence Problem
(\S\ref{sec:post_correspondence}) and Interpreting Strings as Numbers and
Concatenation as Compositions of Affine Transformations
(\S\ref{sec:affine_transformation})

IFS: a collection of $N$ Contractive Affine Transformations with Rational
Coefficients defines a unique Fractal Set which is the Fixed Point
(\emph{Attractor} \S\ref{sec:attractor_repeller}) of a mapping applying the $N$
Affine Transformations and then taking the Union; Approximation (Fixed-point
Iteration ???)

note: allowing for Transformations other than Affine Transformations allows IFSs
to generate Julia Sets (\S\ref{sec:julia_set})

constructing an $\omega$-language (\S\ref{sec:omega_language}) from the Set of
Contractive Affine Transformations $\Sigma$ of an IFS on a Metric Space $(X, d)$
yields a Surjective mapping $\phi : \Sigma^\omega \rightarrow X$, assigning an
``\emph{Address}'' $\sigma \in \Sigma^\omega$ to each Point in the Attractor,
$A \subseteq X$, of the IFS, $\forall x \in X$:
\[
  \phi(\sigma) =
    \lim_{i \rightarrow \infty} \sigma_1(\sigma_2(\ldots(\sigma_i(x))\ldots)) =
    a \in A
\]
that is, from the \emph{Contractivity} of the $\sigma_i$ Transformations, the
Limit $a$ is \emph{independent} of $x$

Determinstic Iterative Algorithm for describing $A$:

initialize a Set $S_1 = \{ B \}$ of Subsets of $X$ with $B \subseteq X$ and
Iteratively apply all $N$ Transformations to each Subset in $S_n$, taking the
Union of the results to be $S_{n+1}$

cf. Fixed-point Iteration \S\ref{sec:fixedpoint_iteration}; in this case the
output of each iteration is $N$ Subsets instead of a single Value

equivalently:
\[
  A = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} S_n
\]

at the $n$-th step, $S_n$ will contain the result of all possible Sequences of
Transformations of length $n$ on the starting Set $B$, i.e.:
\[
  w_{i_1}(w_{i_2}(\ldots(w_{i_n}(B))\ldots))
\]
for all Sequencces $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n$

\emph{Geometric Model of Computation}

\textbf{Lemma 1} \emph{
 For an IFS $\{\reals^2; w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_N\}$ consisting of Affine
 Transformations with Rational Coefficients, and $L$ a Line Segment with
 Rational Endpoints, there is a (Semi)-procedure that Terminates if and only if
 the Attractor $A$ of the IFS does not Intersect $L$.
}

\textbf{Proof} Due to the Contractivity of the Transformations, if at any step
$n$, $L$ does not Intersect, then $L$ will not Intersect on step $n+1$, and so
the Attractor does not Intersect $L$. Conversely, if the Attractor does not
Intersect $L$, then at some step $n$ the intermediate Subsets do not Intersect.
If at any step of running the Deterministic Algorithm on the IFS, none of the
Subsets Intersect $L$, then the Semi-procedure Terminates.

since the Procedure Halts (Accepts) when an Input does not Intersect, the
Attractor represents a graphical ``encoding'' of the Strings \emph{not} in the
Language

cf. other graphical Models of Computation: any Turing Machine can be represented
as a Set of Wang Dominoes that Tile the Plane if and only if the Turing Machine
does not Halt, however in this case the Tiles are more like ``Symbols'' and does
not define in the limiting case a unqiue pattern encoding information about the
behavior of the Machine on all Inputs

one-to-one correspondence between Concatenation of Strings and application of
corresponding Affine Transformations (TODO)

\textbf{Thm. 3, Thm. 4} -- Implies it is Undecidable to test if the Intersection
of the Attractors of two IFSs is empty

an IFS is called \emph{Totally Disconnected} if and only if every Point in $A$
has a \emph{unique} Address, i.e.
$\forall i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}, i \neq j, w_i(A) \cap w_j(A) = \varnothing$

note that being Totally Disconnected is a Property of the IFS, \emph{not} the
Attractor

if an IFS with two Affine Transformations is Totally Disconnected, then its
Attractor is also Totally Disconnected and is therefore a Cantor Set, and if the
IFS is \emph{not} Totally Disconnected, then its Attractor is a Connected Set

a Julie Aset is defined by an IFS with two Transformations that are not Affine
and is therefore either a Conator Set or Connected

an IFS with more than two Transformations might have an Attractor that is
neither a Cantor Set nor Connected

\textbf{Lemma 4} \emph{There exists a Semi-procedure that will Terminate if and
  only if a given IFS is Totally Disconnected}

\textbf{Proof} An IFS is Totally Disconnected if and only if during the
Deterministic Algorithm there is an $i$ such that all the Subsets obtained by
applying all possible Sequences of Transformations of length $i$ are mutually
Disjoint

\textbf{Thm. 5} \emph{It is Undecidable to test if a given IFS is Totally
  Disconnected}
-- i.e. there does not exist a Semi-procedure which Terminates if a given IFS is
\emph{not} Totally Disconnected

Mandelbrot97E

``Roughness'' (\S\ref{sec:rugosity}) in terms of Self-affinity
(\S\ref{sec:self_affinity}) is measured by Roughness Exponent (Hurst Exponent
\S\ref{sec:hurst_exponent}) and a Scale Factor (similar to Root Mean Square
\S\ref{sec:mean_square})

\begin{itemize}
  \item Devil Staircase (\S\ref{sec:devil_staircase})
  \item Fractional Brownian Motion (\S\ref{sec:fractional_brownian})
  \item ...
\end{itemize}

Mandelbrot97E, Ch.6

\emph{\S 4.2 Description of the grid-bound recursive constructions with
  prescribed initiator and generator}

Diagrams

\emph{Level-0 Box} -- sides parallel to $t$ and $x$ Coordinate axes with width
and height chosen to make the box a Square in the Affine Plane

\emph{Initiator} -- an Ordered (Diagonal) Interval crossing a Level-0 Box
from bottom left to top right

\emph{String Generator} -- joins the bottom left of the Initiator to the top
right with a Continuous Piecewise-linear Curve with \emph{Generator Base} $b$
the number of Intervals in the Generator

to ensure the Recursive construction yields the Graph of a Function of Time, the
String Generator must be the Graph of a \emph{Generator Function} $x = G(t)$

Intervals may be Discontinuous (``Axial''), Constant (Horizontal), or otherwise
they are Diagonal and the Rectangle that it crosses diagonally from left to
right defines a \emph{Level-1 Box}

Recursive construction of a \emph{Self-affine Curve} joining the bottom left to
top right using ``refinements'' within a prescribed ``Self-affine Grid'':
\begin{itemize}
  \item draw the Diagonal of the Initiator
  \item replace the Diagonal by the Graph of Generator Function $G(t)$
  \item replace each Diagonal Interval in the Generator with an Affine (Scaled
    and possibly Reflected) Transformation of the Generator
\end{itemize}

as a Recursive construction of an Oscillating ($b \geq 3$) Generator proceeds,
the increments $\Delta u$ over increasingly small Intervals $\Delta t$ tend to
become Symmetrically Distributed, i.e. the Ratio of the number of Positive and
Negative increments tends to $1$; Proof:
\begin{quote}
  after $k$ stages, each increment is the ``product'' of $k$ factors of the form
  $sign(\Delta_i x)$, and $\prod sign(\Delta_i x)$ is Positive if
  $\sum sign(\Delta_i x)$ is Even and Negative if $\sum sign(\Delta_i x)$ is
  Odd; since the Distribution of $\sum sign(\Delta_i x)$ is Binomial and
  ``smoothly varying'' (FIXME: clarify), the Even and Odd values are therefore
  equally frequent Asymptotically
\end{quote}

Dependence Exponent (Hurst Exponent \S\ref{sec:hurst_exponent}) $H$ of the
Diagonal Boxes of the Generator are Finite and Positive

for a Diagonal Box $\beta_i$ with width $\Delta_i t$ and height $\Delta_i x$:
\[
  H_i = \frac{\ln \Delta_i x}{\ln \Delta_i t}
\]
or equivalently:
\[
  \Delta_i x = (\Delta_i t)^H_i
\]
for Non-infinitesimal Boxes, i.e. $H_i$ is a ``coarse'' Coefficient (FIXME:
clarify)

when $\Delta t = b^{-k}$, $\Delta x = b'^{-k}$ for all Boxes at Levels
$k \geq 1$, $H = \frac{\ln b'}{\ln b}$ for all Boxes at all Levels; if the
Level-0 Box has sides $1$ and $B$ (FIXME: instead of $1$ and $1$ ???),
then $H = \frac{\ln b' + \ln B/k}{\ln b}$-- as a ``local concept'', $H$ concerns
the Limit $k \to \infty$ which is unaffected by $B$; for the ``coarse'' $H$ to
be independent of all units of length is achieved $B = 1$

Horizontal Boxes correspond to $H = \infty$ and Axial Boxes to $H = 0$

\emph{Unifractal} -- if the Exponents $H_i$ of each Box $\beta_i$ of the
Generator are all identical and $0 < H_i < \infty$, the construction is
Unifractal; includes ``surrogates'' for Fractional Brownian Motion

note that $H$ only expresses a Ratio beween the sides, so the Unifractal case
may have all Boxes of equal size (``Unibox'') or Boxes of different sizes
(``Multibox''); all Unibox constructions are Unifractal

$b = 4$ Unibox surrogate for (Wiener) Brownian Motion as the projection of a
Peano-Cesaro Motion on the $x$-axis

\emph{Mesofractals} (\S\ref{sec:mesofractal}) -- all Diagonal Boxes have the
same $H$ Exponent, but Axial ($H = 0$) and Horizontal ($H = \infty$) Boxes are
also allowed

a model of $L$-stable Motion (\S\ref{sec:lsm}) by modification of the FBM model
Box widths; Compound constructions with Fractal (``Trading'') Time (Devil
Staircase \S\ref{sec:fractal_time}) are Mesofractals

\emph{Multifractals} (\S\ref{sec:multifractal}) -- each Box $\beta_i$ may have a
different $H_i$ in a range $[H_min, H_max]$ where
$0 < H_{min} < H_{max} < \infty$; Boxes at the $k$-th Level are characterized by
$H$ values \emph{Distributed} over the Interval $[H_{min}, H_{max}]$ in
``increasingly tight fashion'' (FIXME: clarify); the Limit of the Distribution
is described by the \emph{Multifractal Formalism} $f(\alpha)$

a model of Multifractal Motion can be constructed by modifying the widths of the
Boxes of the FBM model by Affine (Invertible) Transformations (cf. the
Transformations of the FBM model into the LSM model are \emph{Non}-invertible)
--FIXME: clarify is this because an interval is lost by ``collapsing'' to an
axial interval or some other reason ???

Compound constructions with Multifractal (``Trading'') Time
(\S\ref{sec:multifractal_time})--i.e. Generator has Monotonic increasing
Diagonals only--are Multifractals

every construction by an Oscillating Generator can be ``rephrased'' as a
Compound Function (FIXME: Process ???) of an FBM followed in a Multifractal Time

Tail Exponent $H_T = \frac{1}{D_T}$

for Unifractal Generators ($H_i = H$ for all $i$), the Trail Dimension
$D_T = \frac{1}{H}$

for Monotone Multifractal Generators, when $\Delta_i x > 0$ for all $i$, then
$\sum\Delta_i t = 1$ implies $D_T = 1$

\emph{Dimension-generating Equation}:
\[
  \sum_i |\Delta_i x|^{D_T} = 1
\]

the Graph Dimension $D_G$ is not functionally related to Trail Dimension $D_T$

when $\Delta_i t = \frac{1}{b}$ for all $i$:
$b^{-H_G} = \frac{1}{b} \sum b^{-H_i}$

intrinsic duration of an Interval in the Generator (TODO)

the construction genreted by an arbitrary Oscillating Generator can be
represented as a construction generated by a Unifractal Oscillating Generator
with Trail Exponent $H_T = \frac{1}{D_T}$ of a Fractal (or Multifractal)
``Trading'' Time

``mild'' vs. ``wild'' Randomness (\S\ref{sec:statistical_randomness})
extrapolated to Non-random Self-affine Fractal constructions

--``fractality is often an excellent surrogate for randomness''

Self-affinity forbids ``slow'' Randomness

``mild'' -- Wiener Process (Brownian Motion) and constructions

``wild'' -- Discontinuous LSM, Fractional Brownian Motion and constructions,
Sporadic Processes

\emph{Extrapolation} of the construction to Level-$(-k)$ -- for a construction
where each Level-$1$ Box is obtained from the original Level-$0$ Box by
reduction of Ratio $b_t$ horizontally and $b_x$ vertically, take a Pre-fractal
Interpolation to the $2k$-th Level and \emph{Dilate} in the ratios $b_t^k$
horizontally and $b_x^k$ vertically, transforming each Level-$(-k)$ Box into a
Unit Square

Interpolation is uniquely specified, Extrapolation is \emph{not}-- Extrapolation
requires selecting the Fixed Point of the Dilation, e.g. the Origin of the $t$-
and $x$-axes (but note that the Fixed Point cannot be located on an Axial or
Horizontal Interval of the Generator); by selecting a Fixed Point at Random, all
Extrapolated Self-affine shapes are ``intrinsically'' Random

Law of Large Numbers for Random Functions: the Limit
$\lim T \to \infty \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{X(t)}{T}$ exists -- holds in the
Unifractal and Mesofractal case, but in the Multifractal case, if the Fixed
Point is chosen Randomly, the Law of Large Numbers fails with Probability $1$
(the Set of Fixed Points for which the Law of Large Numbers holds is of Measure
$0$)

Central Limit Theorem: $\lim T \to \infty \sum X(T)/A(T) - B(T)$ -- no choice of
$A(T)$ makes $X(T)/A(T)$ Converge to a non-trivial Limit (consequence of
Non-random Fractality instead of true Randomness)

Power Law ``explosion'' -- Extrapolating a Multifractal construction $x(t)$ on
$[0, 1]$ to a Time Interval of length $1$ at distance $T$ from the original, as
$T \to \infty$, the increments $\Delta x$ of $x(t)$ of the distant interval will
not ``\emph{regress}'' (FIXME: clarify), e.g. the Average
$|\Delta x|^\frac{1}{H}$ will increase without bound; note Tail lengths also
``explode'' as one Interpolates

the Distribution $L(t, T) = \ln Z(t + T) - \ln Z(t)$ (cf. $L$-stable Motion

as $T \to 0$

\emph{alternative explanation for drift}: Long-term Dependence and
``clustering'' of large changes of $L(t, T)$ means that changes of small $p$ are
unlikely to be observed in a finite sample as $T$ becomes large, reducing the
Histograms Tail

$f(\alpha)$ -- Singularity Spectra (\S\ref{sec:singularity_spectrum}); describes
the Limit Distribution of $H$ Exponents of the Boxes in a grid-bound Recursive
construction of Self-affine Diagrams (\S\ref{sec:selfaffine_fractal})

Multifractals are defined by a number of Scaling Relations and corresponding
Exponents

$\tau$ -- Function defined by list of ``Principal Exponents''; ``fundamental'',
but does not uniquely describe a Multifractal

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\tau_D(q)$ -- \emph{Moment Exponent Function} of the Directing
    Function:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Uniscaling -- $\tau_D(q) = q - 1$ when Multifractal Time reduces to
        Clock Time
      \item Multiscaling -- in the ``cases considered'', $\tau_D(q)$ satisfies
        two conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $\tau_D(0) = -1$, i.e. $\expect((\Delta M)^0) = 1$
          \item $\tau_D(1) = 0$, i.e. $\expect(\Delta M) = \Delta t$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \item $\tau_C(q)$ -- \emph{Power Exponent Function} of the Compound Function:
    $\tau_C(q) = \tau_D(qH)$
\end{itemize}

$\tau'_D(1) = D_1$ -- Fractal Dimension of the Set of values of $\theta(t)$
where the ``bulk'' of the variation of $\theta$ occurs

the Moments of $\Delta M$ ``typically'' take the form:
\[
  \expect((\Delta M)^q) = \Delta t^{\tau_D(q) + 1}
\]

\emph{Moment-based Scaling Exponents} -- the $q$-th Root of the $q$-th Moment is
a \emph{Scale Factor}:
\[
  \Big(\expect(\Delta M)^q\Big)^\frac{1}{q} = \Delta t^{\sigma_D(q)}
\]
where:
\[
  \sigma_D(q) = \frac{1 + \tau_D(q)}{q}
\]

\emph{Uniscaling} -- when Multifractal Time reduces to ``Clock Time'',
$\tau_D(q) + 1 = q$, implies Uniscaling

\emph{Multiscaling} -- Multifractal Increments $\Delta M$ have more than one
characteristic Exponent and therefore have a ``structure'' called
\emph{Multiscaling}, which implies that the Tails of the Compound Process become
shorter as $T$ increases, i.e. the Exponent $\sigma_D(q) \to 0$ as
$q \to \infty$ (FIXME: is this a typo for $\sigma_C(q)$ ???)

not every property of every Multifractal is Scaling, i.e. the Critical Scaling
Exponent $q_{crit}$ need not exist and therefore a Multifractal $\Delta M$ need
not have a Scaling Tail

$B_C = \tau_C(2) = \tau_D(2H)$ -- Spectral Exponent of the Increments of the
Compound Process; the behavior of $\expect(\Delta X^2)$ for $\Delta t \to 0$
determines the behavior of the Spectral Density $S$ of the Increments of $X$ as
$f \to \infty$, in the ``$1/f$'' form:
\[
  S(f) \sim f^{-B_C}
\]
noting that when $H = \frac{1}{2}$, $B_C = \tau_D(1) = 0$, Spectral Analysis is
blind to changes in the Directing Function, and for $H \neq \frac{1}{2}$,
Compounding changes the Spectral Exponent (FIXME: clarify)

\emph{Rectification} of the Increments consists taking the Power $\frac{1}{H}$,
e.g. Squaring in the case of $H = \frac{1}{2}$

$\tau_D(2)$ -- ``Correlation Dimension''

the Spectrum reflects the ``form'' of Dependence, but only in a limited way and
is distinct from the features of $\tau_D(q)$ that affect the shape of the Tails;
in Multifractals, Scaling \emph{may} but need not be present in the Tails, but
are \emph{always} present in the \emph{Dependence}; a FBM of a Multifractal Time
follows the same Scaling rule of Long-run Statistical Dependence as found in FBM

Sample Estimates of the $q$-th Moment by Partitioning an available Sample by
Increments $\Delta t_i$

for FBM $B_H(t)$, $\tau(q) = Hq - 1$, the Trail Dimension $D_T = \frac{1}{H}$,
and the Box Dimension of the Graph $D_G = 1 - \tau_D(qH)$; for Unifractal FBM,
the $D_T$ and $D_G$ are necessarily related by $H$:
\[
  H = \frac{1}{D_T} = 2 - D_G
\]
under a Multifractal Compounding, there is \emph{no} functional relation between
$D_T$ and $D_G$

(\S 3.14) the Asymptotic behavior of the $q$-th Moment Sample Estimates
seperates the properties of the Compound Function $X(\theta)$ from the Directing
Function $\theta(t)$; Estimation of $H$ and $\tau_C(q)$ ...
