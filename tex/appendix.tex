\emph{Inductive Inference}

\emph{Mathematical Induction} is the bottom-up, \emph{Implicative}
process where a \emph{Base Case} is shown to extend to the more
general by means of Implication (the Inductive step). Note that
Mathematical Induction is not \emph{Inductive Reasoning} which is an
empirical or probabilistic Inference and not a form of Deduction. The
\emph{Principle of Mathematical Induction}
(\S\ref{sec:induction_principle}) is an application of Mathematical
Induction to the \emph{Natural Numbers} (\S\ref{sec:natural_number}).
