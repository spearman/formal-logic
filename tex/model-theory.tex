\emph{Model Theory} deals with construction and classification of
\emph{Mathematical Structures} (\S\ref{sec:structure}) as
\emph{Models} (\S\ref{sec:interpretation}) of \emph{Formal Theories}
(\S\ref{sec:formal_theory}).

The Language of Model Theory has two Kinds of Mathematical Objects:
\emph{Sets} and \emph{Relations} (Part \ref{sec:set_theory}). As such
Model Theory forms the \emph{Domain of Discourse} for \emph{Predicate
  Logic} (\S\ref{sec:predicate_logic}).

One definition of Model Theory is the combination of Formal Logic with
\emph{Universal Algebra} (\S\ref{sec:universal_algebra}). An
alternative view of Model Theory equates it with \emph{Algebraic
  Geometry} (Part \ref{sec:algebraic_geometry}). The broadest
definition of Model Theory includes four divisions: Classical Model
Theory, Model Theory of Groups and Fields, Geometric Model Theory, and
Computable Model Theory (\S\ref{sec:computable_model_theory}).



% ====================================================================
\section{Structure}\label{sec:structure}
% ====================================================================

A \emph{Structure} $\mathcal{A}$ is composed of a Set $A$ called the
\emph{Domain} along with a collection of Sets of $n$-ary Relation
Symbols or \emph{Operators} (defined as Subsets of $A^n$) called the
\emph{Signature} (\S\ref{sec:signature}) of $\mathcal{A}$.

Formal definition of a Structure:
\[
    \mathcal{A} = (A, \sigma)
\]
with Domain $A$, Signature $\sigma$.

Combining a Structure with an \emph{Interpretation Function} $I$ gives
a \emph{Model} (\S\ref{sec:interpretation}).

Allowing for \emph{Infinitary Operators} leads to a Theory of
\emph{Complete Lattices}.



% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Domain}\label{sec:domain}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

The \emph{Domain} of a Structure (also called \emph{Carrier Set},
\emph{Underlying Set}, or \emph{Universe}) is a Set of Elements over
which the Relations of the Signature of the Structure are defined. The
Domain $A$ of a Structure $\mathcal{A}$ may also be written as
$dom(\mathcal{A})$ or $|\mathcal{A}|$ (not to be confused with the
Cardinality of the Domain, $|A|$).



% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Signature}\label{sec:signature}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

The \emph{Signature} or \emph{Vocabulary} of a Structure is the Set of
Operators (Functions and Relations) that characterize it. A Structure
with Signature $\sigma$ may be called a \emph{$\sigma$-structure}.

A Signature is given as a triple
\[
    (O,F,P)
\]
where $O$ are Constants, $F$ are Functions, and $P$ are Predicates
(Relations).

A Signature with no Predicate Symbols is an \emph{Algebraic
  Signature}, and the associated Structure an \emph{Algebra}
(\S\ref{sec:universal_algebra}).

A Signature with no Function Symbols is a \emph{Relational Signature},
and the associated Structure is a \emph{Relational Structure}. A
Relational Structure may be used as the basis for a \emph{Relational
  Model} (\S\ref{sec:relational_model}) in \emph{Database Theory}.

The Signature is a synonym for the \emph{Type} of the Structure
(Schematically represented by $\Omega$), and can be written as an
ordered sequence of Natural Numbers representing the arity of the
Operators. The arity, $n$, of a particular Operator symbol, $s$, may
be written $n=ar(s)$.

A \emph{Reduct} of a Structure is created by omitting certain
Operations and Relations from the Signature. The converse is
\emph{Expansion}.



% ====================================================================
\section{Interpretation}\label{sec:interpretation}
% ====================================================================

A Structure that can be given as an \emph{Interpretation} of a Formal
Theory (\S\ref{sec:formal_theory}) is called a \emph{Model} of that
Theory. That is, an Interpretation is a Model if it assigns Truth
values to the Sentences of a Theory. Model Theory uses Tarski's
Semantic Theory of Truth (\S\ref{sec:semantic_truth}) as the
definition of Truth. Model Theory also forms the foundation of
\emph{Formal (Truth-conditional) Semantics}-- a reduction of the
Meaning of Assertions in Natural Languages to their Truth-conditions.

A Model is an Analytic example of a Synthetic Theory. \cite{shulman15}

In Model Theory an Interpretation fixes the \emph{Domain of Discourse}
for expressions of Symbolic Logic (Part \ref{sec:formal_logic}); that
is it assigns the Sets and Relations that Variables can range over.

Roughly, an Interpretation of a Formal Language is an assignment of
\emph{Meanings} to Symbols and \emph{Truth-Conditions}
(\S\ref{sec:semantic_truth}) to Sentences. An Interpretation of
First-order Logic Maps Terms to Individuals in the Universe and
Propositions to Truth Values.

The Interpretation Function in a Mathematical Structure maps Function
and Relation Symbols of the Signature to actual Functions and
Relations on the Domain:
\[
    f^{\mathcal{A}} = I (f)
\]
\[
    R^{\mathcal{A}} = I (R) \subseteq A^{ar(R)}
\]
A Constant (Nullary) Symbol is identified with an Element of the
Domain:
\[
    I(c) \in A
\]

Thus the Interpretation Function is the \emph{Extension}
(\S\ref{sec:set_property}) of the Symbols and Strings of Symbols of
the Object Language.

\section{Satisfaction}\label{sec:satisfaction}
% ====================================================================

When defining a Theory as a set of Sentences in a Formal Language, a
\emph{Model} is an \emph{Interpretation} that \emph{Satisfies} the
Sentences of that Theory. For a Formula $\phi$ and a Structure
$\mathcal{M}$, a \emph{Satisfaction Relation} is denoted:
\[
    \mathcal{M} \vDash \phi
\]
For $\mathcal{M}$ to be a Model of a Theory, $T$, it is required that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Language of $\mathcal{M}$ is the same as the Language of $T$
\item Every Sentence in $T$ is Satisfied by $\mathcal{M}$
\end{itemize}
%FIXME ref completeness theorem
By the Completeness Theorem a Consistent Theory is Satisfiable, that
is, a Theory has a Model if and only if it is Consistent. The
Compactness Theorem (\S\ref{sec:firstorder_properties}) implies
that a Theory has a Model if and only if every Finite Subset of the
Sentences in that Theory also have Models.

% ====================================================================
\section{Quantifier Elimination}
% ====================================================================

Within a Theory $T$, if every First-order Formula $\varphi(x_1,
\ldots, x_n)$ with Quantifiers is equivalent to a First-order Formula
$\psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ without Quantifiers, $T$ is said to have the
property of \emph{Quantifier Elimination}. A Theory without Quantifier
Elimination may be made to have it by adding Symbols to its Signature.



% ====================================================================
\section{Model Completion}\label{sec:model_completion}
% ====================================================================

A First-order Theory $T$ is called \emph{Model Complete} if every
Embedding (\S\ref{sec:sigma_embedding}) of Models of $T$ is an
Elementary Embedding.

A Theory $T^*$ is a \emph{Companion} of another Theory $T$ if every
Model of $T$ can be Embedded in a Model of $T^*$ and likewise every
Model of $T^*$ can be Embedded in a Model of $T$. A \emph{Model
  Companion} is a \emph{Companion} of a Theory that is \emph{Model
  Complete}.

%FIXME ref Amalgamation Property
A \emph{Model Completion} is a Model Companion $T^*$ of a Model $T$
that has the \emph{Amalgamation Property}. This means that every Model
of $T$ can be uniquiely Embedded in a Model of $T^*$.



% ====================================================================
\section{Categoricity}
% ====================================================================

%FIXME ref Cardinal, Lowenheim-Skolem
A Theory is termed \emph{Categorical} if all its Models are
Isomorphic. With this definition and the L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem it
follows that any First-order Theory with a Model of infinite
Cardinality can't be Categorical.

For a Cardinal $\kappa$, a Theory $T$ is \emph{$\kappa$-Categorical}
if any two Models of $T$ of Cardinality $\kappa$ are Isomorphic to one
another. By \emph{Morley's Categoricity Theorem}\cite{morley65} if a
First-order Theory in a Countable Language is Categorical in an
Uncountable Cardinal $\kappa$, then it is Categorical in all
Uncountable Cardinalities. There are three possible cases for
$\kappa$-Categoricity:
\begin{description}
\item[Totally Categorical] $\kappa$-Categorical for all Infinite
  Cardinals
\item[Uncountably Categorical] $\kappa$-Categorical if and only if
  $\kappa$ is an Uncountable Cardinal
\item[Countably Categorical] $\kappa$-Categorical if and only if
  $\kappa$ is a Countable Cardinal
\end{description}
The special case of $\kappa = \aleph_0$ is called
\emph{$\omega$-Categorical}.



% ====================================================================
\section{Interpretability}
% ====================================================================

Given two Structures, $M$ and $N$, an \emph{Interpretation} of $M$ in
$N$ is a pair $(n,f)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item $f:f_{dom} \subset N^n \rightarrow M$ such that the
      $f^k$-preimage of every set $X \subseteq M^k$ definable in $M$
      by a First-order Formula is definable in $N$ by a First-order
      Formula
\end{itemize}

Two Structures are \emph{Bi-interpretable} if they can be interpreted
in each other. This can be used to define an Equivalence Relation
between Structures.



% ====================================================================
\section{Abstract Model Theory}
% ====================================================================

% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Abstract Logic}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

An \emph{Abstract Logic} is a Formal System that consists of a Class
of Sentences with a Satisfaction Relation
(\S\ref{sec:satisfaction}).

%FIXME compactness, lowenheim-skolem
\emph{Lindstr\"om's Theorem} states that First-order Logic is the
Strongest (\S\ref{sec:elementary_class}) Logic which has both
Countable Compactness and the Downward L\"owenheim-Skolem Property.



% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Institutional Model Theory}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\emph{Institutional Model Theory} generalizes First-order Model Theory
to arbitrary Logical Systems formalized as \emph{Institutions}
(\S\ref{sec:institution_theory}).



% ====================================================================
\section{Finite Model Theory}
% ====================================================================

\emph{Finite Model Theory} (FMT) is a restriction of Model Theory to
Interpretations of Finite Structures.

A Finite Structure can always be described by a single First-order
Sentence. An example structure of $n$ Elements:
\[
    \exists x_1 \cdots \exists x_n ( \varphi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge
    \varphi_m )
\]
This may be extended to a Finite number of Structures:
\[
    \exists x_1 \cdots \exists x_n ( \varphi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge
    \varphi_m )
    \vee
    \cdots
    \vee
    \exists x_1 \cdots \exists x_p ( \psi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge
    \psi_q )
\]
Note the difference here with Infinite First-order Model Theory in
which a Model cannot be uniquely determined by a set of First-order
Sentences because of the Compactness Theorem (For every Infinite Model
a Non-isomorphic Model exists).

The ability of a \emph{Property} (\S\ref{sec:set_property}) $P$ to
be expressed in First-order Logic may be determined by whether two
Structures $A \in P$ and $B \notin P$ satisfy all the same First-order
Sentences:
\[
    A \vDash \alpha \leftrightarrow B \vDash \alpha
\]



% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Finite Model Property}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

A System of Logic $S$ has the \emph{Finite Model Property} if there is
a Class of Models $\mathrm{M}$ such that any non-Theorem of $S$ is
Falsified by some Finite Model in $\mathrm{M}$. If $fmp(S)$, $A$ is a
$S$-theorem if and only if $A$ is a Theorem of the Theory of Finite
Models of $S$.

If $S$ is Finitely Axiomatizable (\S\ref{sec:axiom}) and $fmp(S)$ then
it is Decidable (\S\ref{sec:computable_function}).

\subsection{Classification Theory}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\emph{Classification Theory} is the division of Theories based on
their \emph{Stability} which is the ability of the Models of the
Theory to be \emph{Classified}.



% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Types}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

An \emph{$n$-type} of a Model, $\mathcal{M}$, over a (possibly empty)
Subset of Constants, $A \in M$, is a set of Formulas,
$p(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = p(\mathbf{x})$, with at most $n$ Free Variables
in the Language $L(A)$, formed by adding the members of $A$ to the
Language of $\mathcal{M}$:
\[
    L(A) = L \cup \{ c_a : a \in A \}
\]
such that for every Finite Subset $p_0(\mathbf{x}) \subseteq
p(\mathbf{x})$ there exist Elements $b_1,\ldots,b_n \in M$ with
$\mathcal{M} \vDash p_0(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$.

A \emph{Complete Type} is \emph{Maximal}
(\S\ref{sec:formal_theory})) under Inclusion such that $\forall
\phi(\mathbf{x}) \in L(A,\mathbf{x})$ either $\phi(\mathbf{x}) \in
p(\mathbf{x})$ or $\neg \phi(\mathbf{x}) \in p(\mathbf{x})$. A
non-Complete type is called a \emph{Partial Type}.

An $n$-type is \emph{Realized} in $\mathcal{M}$ if there is an Element
$\mathbf{b} \in M^n$ such that $\mathcal{M} \vDash
p(\mathbf{b})$. This is guaranteed by the Compactness Theorem
(\S\ref{sec:firstorder_properties}) in either $\mathcal{M}$ or an
Elementary Extension (\S\ref{sec:model_substructure}) of
$\mathcal{M}$. This is denoted by $tp_{n}^{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbf{b}/A)$
which is read as ``the Complete Type of $\mathbf{b}$ over $A$''.

A Type $p(\mathbf{x})$ is \emph{Isolated} by a Formula
$\varphi(\mathcal{x})$ if $\forall \psi(\mathbf{x}) \in
p(\mathbf{x})$, $\varphi (\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow
\psi(\mathbf{x})$. Isolated Types are Realized in every Elementary
Substructure or Extension.



\subsubsection{Saturation}\label{sec:model_saturation}

A Model $\mathcal{M}$ is \emph{$\kappa$-saturated} (where $\kappa$ is
a Cardinal number) if for all $A \subseteq M$ of Cardinality $<
\kappa$, $M$ Realizes all Complete Types over $A$. A Model is
\emph{Saturated} if it is $|M|$-saturated where $|M|$ is the
Cardinality of $M$.



% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Stability}\label{sec:model_stability}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------

A Theory $T$ is \emph{$\kappa$-stable} for an Infinite Cardinal $\kappa$
if for every set $A$ such that $|A| = \kappa$, the Set of Complete
Types over $A$ has Cardinality $\kappa$. Theories are Classified with
the following terms:
\begin{description}
\item [Stable] $\kappa$-stable for some Infinite Cardinal $\kappa$
\item [Unstable] not $\kappa$-stable for all Infinite Cardinals $\kappa$
\item [Superstable] $\kappa$-stable for all sufficiently large
  Cardinals $\kappa$
\item [Totally Transcendental] \emph{Morley Rank}\cite{morley65} less
  than $\infty$
