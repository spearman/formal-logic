\section{$\sigma$-algebra}\label{sec:sigma_algebra}
% ==============================================================================

a \emph{$\sigma$-algebra} is a Set Algebra (Field of Sets
\S\ref{sec:set_algebra}) that is Closed under Countable Intersections and
Countable Unions and the corresponding Field of Sets is called a
\emph{Measurable Space} (\S\ref{sec:measurable_space})

a $\sigma$-algebra on a Set $X$ is a Non-empty Set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq 2^X$
that is Closed under Set Operations of Complement
(\S\ref{sec:absolute_complement}) and Countable Union (\S\ref{sec:set_union})

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\varnothing \in \mathcal{A}$
  \item $X \in \mathcal{A}$
  \item $(E_i)_{i \geq 1} \in \mathcal{A} \Rightarrow
    \bigcap_{i \geq 1} E_i \in \mathcal{A}$
\end{enumerate}

cf. \emph{Field of Probabilities} (\S\ref{sec:probability}) (Kolmogorov33)

the effect of a $\sigma$-algebra is to restrict the Domain so that not every
Subset of a Sample Space needs to have a Probability which is crucial for
Probabilities to be defined on Uncountably Infinite Sets
(\url{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-probability/#ProSpa})

\fist on Finite or Countably Infinite Sets, every $\sigma$-algebra is a
\emph{Topology} (\S\ref{sec:topology}), and on every Uncountable Set there is a
$\sigma$-algebra that \emph{isn't} a Topology, viz. the
\emph{Countable-cocountable $\sigma$-algebra}
--\url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/51222/is-there-an-example-of-a-sigma-algebra-that-is-not-a-topology}

Probability of a Countable Sequence of Disjoint Sets (Mutually Exclusive Events

Collection of all Borel Sets (\S\ref{sec:borel_set}) on a Topological Space $X$
forms the \emph{Borel Algebra} on $X$ which is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra
containing all Open Sets (or equivalently all Closed Sets) of $X$

any Measure defined on the Borel Sets is called a Borel Measure
(\S\ref{sec:borel_measure})

on $\reals$: $\struct{B}_\reals$ is equal to the Minimal $\sigma$-algebra
Generated by the Closed Sets $E_2 = \{ [a,b] \;|\; a < b \}$.

a Measurable Space is the Field of Sets underlying a $\sigma$-algebra

(wiki):

a \emph{Measurable Space} or \emph{Borel Space} is a Set $X$ together with a
$\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$ on the Set:
\[
  (X,\Sigma)
\]
Members of $\Sigma$ are called \emph{Measurable Sets}
(\S\ref{sec:measurable_set}), and Functions between Measurable Spaces such that
the Preimages are Measurable are called \emph{Measurable Functions}
(\S\ref{sec:measurable_function})

\fist a \emph{Measure Space} (\S\ref{sec:measure_space}) is a Measurable Space

Measurable Spaces

(Tao10): the notion of a Measurable Space, $(X,\sigma)$, and Measurable
Functions (\S\ref{sec:measurable_function}) is similar to that of a
\emph{Topological Space} (\S\ref{sec:topological_space}), $(X,\tau)$, and
Continuous Functions (\S\ref{sec:continuous_function}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item both $\tau$ and $\sigma$ contain both $\varnothing$ and $X$
  \item $\tau$ is closed under Finite Intersections and Finite or Infinite
    Unions
  \item $\sigma$ is closed under Complement and Countable Unions (and,
    by implication, Countable Intersections)
\end{itemize}
The Open Sets $\tau$ of a Topological Space \emph{generate} a $\sigma$-algebra,

\subsection{Measurable Function}\label{sec:measurable_function}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a \emph{Measurable Function} is a Function between two Measurable Spaces such
that the Preimage of any Measurable Set is Measurable

for a Measure Space $(E, X, \mu)$ and Function $f : E \rightarrow \reals$, an
equivalent requirement is that the Pre-image of any Borel Subset
(\S\ref{sec:borel_set}) of $\reals$ is in $X$

\fist cf. Continuous Functions (\S\ref{sec:continuous_function}) -- a Function
between Metric Spaces (\S\ref{sec:metric_space}) is Continuous if the Preimage
of each Open Set is Open

Measurable Functions are closed under Algebraic Operations, and Point-wise
Sequential Limits:
\begin{align*}
  & \sup_{k\in\nats} f_k \\
  & {\lim \inf}_{k\in\nats} f_k \\
  & {\lim \sup}_{k\in\nats} f_k \\
\end{align*}
are Measurable if the original Sequence $(f_k)_k, k \in \nats$ consists of
Measurable Functions

\fist Lebesgue Integrals (\S\ref{sec:lebesgue_integral})

a Random Variable (\S\ref{sec:random_variable}) is defined as a Measurable
Function:
\[
  X : \Omega \rightarrow E
\]
where $(\Omega,\mathbb{P})$ is a Probability Space (i.e. a Measure Space with a
Probability Measure) and $E$ is an arbitrary Measurable Space

A \emph{Measure} on a Measurable Space (\S\ref{sec:measurable_space})
$(X,\Sigma)$ is a Function:
\[
  \mu : \Sigma \rightarrow [0,\infty]
\]
Satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\forall E \in \Sigma, \mu(E) \geq 0$ -- \emph{Non-negativity}
  \item $\mu(\varnothing) = 0$ -- \emph{Null Empty Set}
  \item For $(E_i)_{i \geq 1} \in \Sigma$ with $E_i \cap E_j = \varnothing$
    when $i \neq j$, then:

      \mu (\bigcup_i E_i) = \sum_i \mu(E_i)
    \]
    -- \emph{Countable Additivity} (\emph{$\sigma$-additivity})
\end{enumerate}
Note that a \emph{Signed Measure} (\S\ref{sec:signed_measure}) does not require
Property (1.) of Non-negativity.

$(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ is called a \emph{Measure Space} (\S\ref{sec:measure_space})
and a Measure Space with a Probability Measure
(\S\ref{sec:probability_measure}) is a \emph{Probability Space}
(\S\ref{sec:probability_space}); a Probability Measure must assign a value of

(wiki):

an \emph{Outer Measure} (or \emph{Exterior Measure}) on a Set $X$ is a Function
on the Power Set of $X$, $\varphi : 2^X \rightarrow [0, \infty]$, Satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\varphi(\varnothing) = 0$ -- \emph{Null Empty Set}
  \item $A,B \in X, A \subseteq B \Rightarrow \varphi(A) \leq \varphi(B)$ --

    \]
    -- \emph{Countable Subadditivity}
\end{enumerate}

a Subset $E \subseteq X$ is \emph{$\varphi$-measurable} (or
\emph{Carath\'eodory-measurable} by $\varphi$) if and only if for every Subset
$A \subseteq X$:
\[
  \varphi(A) = \varphi(A \cap E) + \varphi(A \cap \bar{E})

\subsubsection{Lebesgue Outer Measure}\label{sec:lebesgue_outer_measure}

for a Subset $E \subseteq \reals$ and for Intervals $I = [a,b]$ with lengths
$\ell(I) = b-a$, the \emph{Lebesgue Outer Measure} $\lambda^*(E)$ is defined as:
\[
  \lambda^*(E) = \inf \Big\{ \sum_k^\infty \ell(I_k) : (I_k)_{k \in \nats}
    \text{is a Sequence of Intervals with Open Boundaries with}
    E \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k \Big\}
\]

the Lebesgue Outer Measure reduces the Subsets $E \subseteq \reals$ to its Outer
Measure by \emph{Coverage} by Sets of Open Intervals-- each such Set of
Intervals $I$ \emph{Covers} $E$ in the sense that when the Intervals are
combined by Union, they Contain $E$; the total length of any Covering Interval
can \emph{overestimate} the Measure of $E$, since the Intervals may include
Points which are not in $E$; the Lebesgue Outer Measure is the Greatest Lower
Bound (Infimum \S\ref{sec:greatest_lowerbound}) of the lengths from all possible
Sets of Intervals-- i.e. it is the total length of Interval Sets which ``fit''
$E$ most tightly and do not overlap

the \emph{Lebesgue Measure} (\S\ref{sec:lebesgue_measure}) is defined on the
Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra which is the collection of Subsets $E$ Satisfying the
\emph{Carath\'eodory Criterion} for every $A \subseteq \reals$:
\[
  \lambda^*(A) = \lambda^*(A \cap E) + \lambda^*(A \cap \bar{E})
\]
and the Lebesgue Measure $\lambda$ is given by the Lebesgue outer Measure:
$\lambda(E) = \lambda^*(E)$

this further requirement ensures that using a Set $E$ to Partition an arbitrary
Set $A$ by Set Difference of $A$ and $E$ results in Sets whose Outer Measures
Sum to the original Set $A$, i.e. the Sets $E$ are \emph{Lebesgue Measurable}

\emph{$n$-dimensional Volume}; standard way of assigning a Measure to Subsets of

Measure of Subsets of $\reals$

the \emph{Lebesgue Measure} is defined on the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra which is
the collection of Subsets $E \subseteq \reals$ Satisfying the
\emph{Carath\'eodory Criterion} for every $A \subseteq \reals$:
\[
  \lambda^*(A) = \lambda^*(A \cap E) + \lambda^*(A \cap \bar{E})
\]
and the Lebesgue Measure $\lambda$ is given by the Lebesgue Outer Measure
(\S\ref{sec:lebesgue_outer_measure}): $\lambda(E) = \lambda^*(E)$

the Lebesgue Outer Measure reduces the Subsets $E \subseteq \reals$ to its Outer
Measure by \emph{Coverage} by Sets of Open Intervals-- each such Set of
Intervals $I$ \emph{Covers} $E$ in the sense that when the Intervals are
combined by Union, they Contain $E$; the total length of any Covering Interval

Bound (Infimum \S\ref{sec:greatest_lowerbound}) of the lengths from all possible
Sets of Intervals-- i.e. it is the total length of Interval Sets which ``fit''
$E$ most tightly and do not overlap

the further requirements of the Lebesgue Measure ensures that using a Set $E$ to

whose Outer Measures Sum to the original Set $A$, i.e. the Sets $E$ are
